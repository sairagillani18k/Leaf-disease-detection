# Plant Leaf Disease Detection

Plant diseases have long been a formidable adversary for farmers worldwide. These diseases can significantly reduce crop yields, leading to economic losses and food scarcity. Traditionally, farmers have relied on manual inspection to identify disease symptoms. However, this process is time-consuming and often prone to errors.

In this project, I use computer vision to automatically detect dieseases in leaves. This technology empowers farmers to tackle diseases efficiently, reduce losses, and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
